# Grit and Growth Mindset


## 1. Grit

### Question 1: Video paraphrasing

The speaker Angela Lee Duckworth, left a job in management consulting to become a teacher and realized over time that IQ was not the only predictor of student success. She conducted research in various settings and found that grit, defined as passion and perseverance for very long-term goals, was a significant predictor of success. She corelates grit to having stamina, to sticking with your future, & working hard to achieve a dream. Its more like a marathon than a sprint. Gritty individuals had more chances of graduating, even when accounting for other factors like family income and standardized test scores. Though there is still a lot to learn about how to develop grit in a person but she conveys that a growth mindset, the belief that abilities can change with effort, are helpful.

### Question 2: Key takeaways to take action on:

* We need to develop a growth mindset

* We need to test our best ideas and strongest intuitions

* We have to be willing to fail to learn better and to start over again without hesitation

* Persistance in trying to be more gritty can help us develop grit

## 2. Growth Mindset

### Question 3: Video Paraphrasing 
The concept of "growth mindset," popularized by Stanford professor Carol Dweck, suggests that people's beliefs about their abilities play a crucial role in their learning and development. 

The speaker,Trevor Ragan, tells us that there are two kinds of mindset: Fixed mindset and Growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes that skills are innate and cannot be changed and thus, they don't see the value of putting in efforts. They avoid challenging situations and fear making mistakes because they think too much about how they would look bad if they faltered. They don't see any value in feedbacks because they don't believe they have the capacity to grow.

 A growth mindset believes that skills can be developed through effort and practice. Hence, they see value in putting in efforts because they believe they have the capacity to grow. They are more likely to take on a challenge and persevere on it because they take challenges as an opportunity to grow. By embracing the process of growth they understand the importance of making mistakes and learning from them. They also appreciate and work on feedbacks because they believe these will help them to grow.

 ### Question 4: Key take-aways:
 
  * Every individual on different times and in different situations can either have a fixed mindset or a growth mindset 

  * Those with a growth mindset tend to learn and achieve more over time compared to those with a fixed mindset

  * Understanding the key characteristics of these mindsets, such as beliefs about effort, challenges, mistakes, and feedback, can impact our behaviors towards learning
  
  * A growth mindset emphasizes that skills are acquired through effort and practice, and embracing challenges, mistakes, and feedback are essential for learning and improvement
  
  * A fixed mindset will only hinder our progress and make us believe that we do not have any scope of improvement
  
  * To create a good culture of learning its important to work on our beliefs and focus to create a growth mindset

## 3. Understanding Internal Locus of Control

### Question 5: What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?

**Internal Locus of Control :** 

Locus of control is defined as the degree to which you believe you have control over your life.

Internal Locus of Control is the belief that one's own actions and decisions have a significant impact on the outcomes of their life, rather than external factors such as luck or fate. Its opposite to the external locus of control, which is a belief that external factors such as luck, fate, or the actions of others have a greater influence on their outcomes. 

This concept is often used in psychology and management to understand an individual's beliefs about their control over their own lives and work.


**Key take-aways:**

* Adopting an internal locus of control is the key to staying motivated

* The curse of having an external locus of control is that when you feel like nothing you do matters, you stop doing things/trying

* Solving problems in our own life and then taking time to appreciate the fact that it was our actions that gave us a solution or results is the way to develop an internal locus of control

## 4. How to build a Growth Mindset

### Question 6: Video Paraphrasing

Developing a growth mindset is essential for achieving growth. A growth mindset is characterized by a belief in one's ability to grow and get better, while a fixed mindset holds that people are born with certain talents and abilities and cannot change. 

The first step to developing a growth mindset is to believe in your ability to figure things out. This belief is the ultimate belief in life, as it enables people to embark on a journey of lifelong learning and growth. The second step is to question your assumptions. People should not let their current knowledge, skills, and ability limit their vision for the future. Instead, they should question assumptions that limit them and prevent them from having a growth mindset. The third step is to develop your own life curriculum. People should have a set of books, tapes, or audio digital programs, as well as attend seminars, that help them learn and grow. They should identify what they are passionate about and architect a curriculum to make their dreams possible. 

Developing a growth mindset is crucial for achieving success, both in personal and professional lives.
