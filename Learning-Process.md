# Learning Process

## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique by Thomas Frank

' If we cannot explain it simply, then we don't understand it well enough '

This quote (which is often attributed to Albert Einstien) when reversed, reveals a vital piece of advice that can be key to enhancing the learning process for any individual.

' If we want to learn something well enough, we should try to explain it '

### **Feynman Technique**

The Feynman Technique is named after the physicist Richard Feynman. A Nobel prize winner for his work in the field of quantum electrodynamics.

The technique states that, to explain something we need to understand it well. This also tells us that explaining something helps us to grasp a concept better and is the ultimate test of our understanding of the topic.

Feynman laid out the importance of explaining a topic/concept. Explaining a concept helps us to improve our understanding of that concept irrespective of the field/domain we apply it.

**Benefits**:

* Explaining helps us get a stronger hold on the concepts that we are confident in.

* Explaining lets us rectify/pinpoint/discover the concepts or topics we are underconfident or shaky in.

* Trying to explain a topic is the quickest way to learn a topic.

* Trying to explain a topic can help us test our understanding of the topic.

### **Ways to use Feynman Technique**

There are four key steps to the Feynman Technique:

1. Take a sheet of paper and write the concept that we want to learn at the top.

2. Try to explain the concept in the easiest/simplest way possible (Imagine we are explaining it to a 12-year-old). Try to use examples and test cases.

3. Reflect on the quality of our explanation. Attempt to refine it and make it even simpler to understand.

4. Organizing our thoughts and reviewing our explanations. Try to pinpoint complex terms/jargon and challenge ourselves to simplify them.

### **Paraphrase:**
The speaker Barbara Oakley shares her experience about how after various experiences she asked herself what if she too could get ideas unknown/foreign to her? and learn a new language. So she tried to change the way she used to learn till now. She wanted to find a way she could learn much more easily
and effectively.

So, she began reaching out to experts in neuroscience and cognitive psychology to find the keys to learning effectively.

She discovered that we can simplify the brain's operation into two fundamentally different modes:

1. Focus Mode
2. Diffuse Mode

She realized how we can use these modes and enhance our learning experience.

The focus mode turns our attention to something and attempts at staying on it.
It binds itself to the previously laid pipelines/laws and works in accordance with them. 

Meanwhile, the diffused mode is a relaxed set of neural states. If the thought we're thinking is a new thought, a new concept, or a new technique that we've never thought of before, we need a different way of thinking,
a new perspective in a sense, and that's provided here by the diffuse mode. 

So when we're learning, we're going back and forth between the focus and the diffuse mode. 

Taking examples of Salvador Dali and Albert Einstien, she explained how they both, whenever stuck on some problem, they'd sit down and relax and just as they'd be nearly asleep, an object would fall from their hands and wake them up. They'd then take those ideas from the diffuse mode over to the focus mode, where they could work with them and solve/improve their situation.

In the case of procrastination, we just turn
our attention away to feel better momentarily. Repeating this turns it into an addiction, which can wreak havoc on our lives.

The solution for this is Pomodoro Technique. In this, we are supposed to work with focused attention for 25 minutes. After that take a break. This enhances our ability to have focused attention, and we're also practicing our ability to relax a little bit. 

We also make the mistake of considering some of our absolute best traits as our worst traits. She discussed a few cases:

* Poor memory:\
It often means that we are more creative.
Because we can't hold these ideas in mind so tightly, other ideas are often creeping in.

* Tension:\
Diverting off into some other idea suggests the person is more creative because new ideas tend to slip in repeatedly.

* Slow thinking:\
If someone is a slower thinker, they may have to work harder to grasp the materials, but we gain solid mastery of what we're studying. 

* ' Illusions of competence in learning ':\
This means that we can study all day long and we'd be still at square one due to a lack of effective study techniques.

* Test anxiety:\
Anxiety arises because we have just learned that we are not a master of the topic.

* Exercise:\
Exercise can increase our ability to both learn and remember.


She talked about how we could improve the way we take tests and do homework and also how highlighting is not the best way to recall something.

In the end, she emphasized combining understanding a topic with practice and repetition in a variety of circumstances.

###  **Some Steps to Improve the Learning Process** 

* Understanding is great, but we can try to combine it with practice and repetition under various situations.

* Instead of highlighting a piece of information, we can try to look away and try to recall whatever we remember about the topic.

* In cases where we tend to procrastinate, we can try using the Pomodoro Technique which includes trying to focus on a task/topic for 25 minutes and then taking a rest.

* We can include exercising which can also help improve the ability to learn and remember.

## 3. Learn Anything in 20 hours by Josh Kaufman

### **Key Takeaways:**

* It takes around 10,000 hours to get to the top of an ultra-competitive field in a very narrow subject

* Little practice consistently initially can improve your skills drastically but after a point, you'd need to put in much more effort for even the tiny improvements

* It takes nearly 20 hours to go from being grossly incompetent in a specific skill to being reasonably good.

* You can go from knowing nothing about a field/skill to being astoundingly skilled with 20 hours (less than 45 mins a day for 30 days) of focused deliberate practice.

* The major barrier to learning a skill is not intellectual, it's often emotional. As individuals, we do not want to feel stupid or extremely incompetent at something.

### **Some Steps to Take While Approaching a New Topic**



1. Deconstruct the skill:
Decide what you want to be able to do with what you intend to learn. Most skills are a bundle of skills. Select only the skills necessary for you to reach your goal initially and work on them. This shall help you to be able to improve performance in the least amount of time possible.

2. Learn enough to self-correct:
Get at least 3-5 resources on what you are trying to learn. Not to learn from them fully, but to learn just enough to practice and self-correct. This helps you notice you're making a mistake while you make it.

3. Remove barriers to practice:
Try to remove barriers like television, the internet, social media, noises, or anything that diverts/dampens your attention or delays you from starting your actual progress on the skill.

4. Practice for at least 20 hours:
By pre-committing yourself to practice the skill for at least 20 hours, you will be able to overcome the frustration that happens due to being grossly incompetent at the beginning of any skill. It will help you stick to practicing for enough time to reap astounding rewards.
