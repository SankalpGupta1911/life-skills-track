# Tiny Habits

## Question 1: Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

- The speaker, BJ Fogg teaches at Stanford University and his work is about behavior change and how to design for it.

- Fogg introduces the concept of "tiny habits" and asks the audience to participate in a behavior change exercise by flossing one tooth and celebrating the victory.

- He discusses different ways to celebrate victories in behavior change, such as saying "I'm awesome" or doing a little dance.

- He also shares his personal experience with behavior change, including doing push-ups after using the restroom as a way to incorporate exercise into their daily routine.

- Fogg explains that there are 15 ways behaviors can change, and emphasizes that changing the environment and relying on motivation are two key ways to achieve long-term behavior change.

## Question 2: Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible

The video discusses the concept of the "Tiny Habits" method, as introduced by author and behavioral scientist BJ Fogg. Fogg proposes a universal formula for human behavior, which is Motivation + Ability + Prompt (MAP). According to this formula, a new habit can be developed and consistently performed if the motivation and ability required for the habit are matched, and a prompt is present.

The method involves three parts. First, the habit is shrunk to the tiniest possible version that can be done in 30 seconds or less, reducing the need for high levels of motivation. Second, an action prompt is identified, which can be an external prompt like an alarm or an internal prompt like a thought or emotion that reminds you to act. Finally, the habit is nurtured and grown over time with some "shine", meaning continued effort and attention to make the habit feel natural and become a part of daily life.

Fogg suggests that by using the Tiny Habits method, one can overcome the common pitfalls of relying solely on motivation, and instead create lasting changes in behavior by making habits easy to do and consistently prompting their execution.

## Question 3: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?

B = MAP is a formula that can help us make new habits easier. Here's how it works:

Motivation: Find reasons that personally matter to us for doing the new habit, such as health benefits or personal goals.

Ability: Make the habit easy to do by simplifying the process and removing any obstacles that might get in the way.

Prompt: Use reminders or cues to trigger the habit, like setting alarms or placing visual cues in our environment.

By focusing on motivation, ability, and prompts, we can make it easier to adopt and maintain new habits in our daily life.

## Question 4 - Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating or "shining" after completing a habit is important because it helps reinforce the habit in our brains. When we celebrate, our brains release feel-good chemicals that make us want to repeat the behavior. It also helps keep us motivated and builds our belief in our ability to continue the habit.

Celebrating creates positive emotions and makes the habit more enjoyable, which can help make it a natural part of our daily routine. Overall, celebrating successful habit completion can make the habit stick and increase our chances of long-term success. The habit is nurtured and grown over time with some "shine", meaning continued effort and attention to make the habit feel natural and become a part of daily life.

## Question 5: Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

The philosophy of the aggregation of marginal gains: Small improvements, tiny habits, and little choices can lead to significant success over time.
Importance of creating specific plans and designing an environment for positive habits: Establishing core habits, giving goals a time and place, and being intentional about the environment can support successful habit formation.
The "two-minute rule": Any habit can be started in less than two minutes, and optimizing for the beginning of the task makes it easier to get started.
"Liking" is a key factor in repeating behaviors: We repeat behaviors because we enjoy the rewards or consequences associated with them, and bringing rewards into the present moment can make habits stick.
The "Seinfeld strategy": Using a wall calendar to track progress on a daily task and leveraging short-term feedback for long-term behavior change.

## Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes, and outcomes.

James Clear offers a multifaceted perspective on habit formation through the lens of identity, processes, and outcomes.

From the perspective of identity, Clear argues that habits are not just about what you do, but also about who you believe you are. He emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your desired identity, as habits are powerful tools for shaping and reinforcing your sense of self. By identifying yourself as someone who possesses certain habits, you are more likely to internalize and maintain those habits over time.

In terms of processes, Clear presents a framework for understanding the habit loop, which consists of cues, cravings, responses, and rewards. He highlights the importance of identifying and manipulating these components to shape and optimize your habits. For example, he suggests using habit stacking, where you attach a new habit to an existing one, and habit tracking, where you monitor your progress, as effective processes for habit formation.

Regarding outcomes, Clear emphasizes the need to focus on the small, incremental changes that habits can bring about. He advocates for the concept of "the 1% rule," which suggests that small improvements in your habits can compound over time and lead to significant positive outcomes. By focusing on the process of habit formation and the small changes that occur over time, rather than solely fixating on immediate results, you can cultivate lasting positive changes in your life.

In summary, "Atomic Habits" presents a comprehensive perspective on habit formation, encompassing the interplay of identity, processes, and outcomes. By aligning your habits with your desired identity, optimizing habit processes, and focusing on incremental changes, you can cultivate positive habits that lead to lasting personal growth and improvement.

## Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier.

James Clear's book provides insights on how to simplify the process of developing and maintaining good habits. One key perspective is the concept of "habit stacking," which involves attaching a new habit to an existing one to create a strong association. For example, linking a new habit like exercise to an existing habit like brushing your teeth can make it easier to adopt. The book also emphasizes the importance of designing your environment to support good habits by making small changes to make desired behaviors easier and undesired behaviors harder. Additionally, it highlights the significance of reducing friction to start a habit by making the first step as easy as possible. By implementing these strategies, you can create an environment that promotes positive habits and makes it easier to achieve your goals.

## Question 8:

In "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, the book emphasizes the importance of making bad habits more difficult to break their grip. Clear suggests several strategies to deter the formation of undesirable habits. One approach is to identify and remove triggers or cues that prompt the bad habit. For example, if you tend to snack on unhealthy foods while watching TV, you can remove those snacks from your home or avoid watching TV altogether. Another strategy is to introduce friction or obstacles to the bad habit. For instance, if you want to reduce your social media usage, you can delete social media apps from your phone or set up time-consuming password prompts. Clear also advocates for changing the environment to make bad habits less accessible and replacing them with healthier alternatives. By increasing the effort required to engage in negative habits, readers can disrupt the automaticity of those behaviors and make them less appealing over time.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

As a junior software engineer, I would like to establish a habit of practicing coding exercises regularly to enhance my coding skills. Drawing insights from BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits TED Talk and James Clear's "Atomic Habits," here are the steps I can take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive, and the response satisfying.

Firstly, I can make the cue obvious by setting a specific time and place for my coding exercises. This could involve scheduling a recurring time slot in my calendar or setting a reminder on my phone. Additionally, I can create a designated workspace with all the necessary tools and resources for coding, making it easy to start when the cue arises.

To make the habit more attractive, I can find coding challenges or projects that align with my interests or career goals. This could involve seeking out coding exercises that are relevant to my current projects or exploring new technologies that I am curious about. I can also make the habit enjoyable by incorporating elements such as gamification, competing with friends, or learning in a collaborative environment.

To make the habit easy, I can break down my coding exercises into smaller, manageable tasks and set realistic goals. For example, I can start with shorter coding exercises or commit to coding for a specific duration each day, gradually increasing the difficulty or duration over time. I can also remove any distractions or barriers, such as turning off notifications on my phone or blocking distracting websites during my coding exercises.

Lastly, I can make the response satisfying by tracking my progress and celebrating my achievements. This could involve keeping a log of completed coding exercises, using a coding platform that provides feedback and rewards for completing tasks or sharing my progress with a mentor or colleague. Celebrating milestones and progress can provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue the habit.

By following these steps and making the cue obvious, the habit more attractive, the habit easy, and the response satisfying, I can increase the likelihood of incorporating regular coding exercises into my routine and ultimately improve my coding skills as a junior software engineer.

## Question 10: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I would like to eliminate the habit of excessive social media use during work hours. I can make the cue invisible by removing visual or auditory triggers, such as turning off notifications or keeping my phone in another room. I can make the process unattractive by associating negative consequences with social media distractions and creating a list of tasks that I'm delaying by procrastinating on social media. Lastly, I can make the response unsatisfying by establishing a "cost" for engaging in social media, such as requiring completion of work or reaching a milestone before allowing myself to check it. By implementing these steps, I can reduce the habit's appeal, decrease its likelihood of repetition, and enhance my focus and productivity as a junior software engineer.
