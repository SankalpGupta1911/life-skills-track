# Energy Management

## Manage Energy not Time

### Question 1: What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?

- a basketball/volleyball/table-tennis/football/pool match or a swimming session
- painting
- singing/playing guitar/dancing
- I like to go for a random walk, try some street food and observe a busy street
- Rarely do I go for a smoke or a drink
- In most cases, I take a shower and then go to a good sleep

### Question 2: When do you find getting into the Stress quadrant?

- When the deadlines approach and I am not done with the amount of work I was supposed to be done with
- When I begin to contemplate the uncertainty of the future
- When I start backtracking and doubting the decisions I took
- When I am unsure what I want to accomplish as an individual 


### Question 3: How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?

- When I can't care about anything besides what's going on in the present 
- When I accomplish a goal I didn't think I was able to
- Completing a painting, finishing learning how to play a song on guitar, or learning a new trick or skill
- Whenever I cook something and it turns out good
- Basically, learning anything new gets me excited (Mostly growth in vertical domains)

## Sleep is your superpower

### Question 4 - Paraphrase the Sleep is your Superpower video in detail.

- Insufficient sleep may have adverse effects on reproductive health for both males and females.
- Learning and memory functions in the brain are dependent on adequate sleep.
- Sleep is vital before and after learning for memory consolidation.
- Memory consolidation is disrupted when there is a lack of sleep, resulting in an inability to acquire new memories.
- Studies have demonstrated that sleep deprivation results in a 40% reduction in the brain's capacity to form new memories.
- Deprivation of sleep hinders the brain's ability to process new experiences and form new memories.
- High-quality sleep is required each day to restore and enhance memory and learning capabilities.
- Sleep spindles, which are brief bursts of electrical activity during deep sleep, facilitate the transfer of memories from short-term to long-term storage.
- Disruption of deep sleep contributes to cognitive and memory deterioration in aging and Alzheimer's disease.
- The positive aspect of this is that understanding sleep physiology may help improve memory and learning abilities and prevent cognitive decline.

### Question 5 - What are some ideas that you can implement to sleep better?

- Establishing a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day can aid in regulating the body's internal clock and enhancing overall sleep quality.

- To create a sleep-conducive environment, ensure that the bedroom is quiet, cool, and dark, and use comfortable bedding and pillows.

- Limiting exposure to screens is crucial as the blue light they emit can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Avoid using phones, tablets, and computers for at least an hour before going to bed.

- Incorporating relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation can help soothe the mind and promote relaxation, leading to a more restful sleep.

- Creating a mental association between your bed and sleep can help promote better sleep hygiene. By making your bed an exclusive space for sleeping, you can condition your mind to associate it only with relaxation.

- Avoid using your bed for activities like work, watching TV, or browsing the internet, as this can disrupt the mental association between your bed and sleep. By doing so, you can train your brain to recognize your bed as a place solely for sleeping, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.

## Brain-Changing Benefits of Exercise

### Question 6 - Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise. Minimum 5 points.

- Physical activity provides both immediate and long-lasting benefits for the brain, including protection against conditions such as depression, Alzheimer's, and dementia, as well as improved mood and focus.

- The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are crucial areas of the brain responsible for decision-making, attention, personality, and the formation and retention of new long-term memories.

- As a neuroscientist, the speaker was interested in studying the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus to understand how brief bursts of electrical activity enable us to form new memories. However, the speaker's sedentary lifestyle made him miserable, and he realized that he needed to make changes to his routine.

- After incorporating regular exercise into his life, the speaker noticed a boost in mood and energy levels, lost 25 pounds and saw improvements in his focus and long-term memory.

- The speaker's personal experience is supported by a growing body of literature demonstrating that physical activity has similar positive effects on mood, energy, memory, and attention.


### Question 7 - What are some steps you can take to exercise more?

- Set a specific exercise goal, such as walking for 30 minutes a day or training for a marathon.

- Create a consistent exercise schedule and treat it like any other appointment.

- Find a physical activity that you enjoy, like dancing, swimming, or hiking.

- Mix up your workouts to keep things interesting and challenge your body.

- Consider finding a workout buddy to make exercise a social activity.

- Track your progress and celebrate your achievements to stay motivated and see your improvements.
