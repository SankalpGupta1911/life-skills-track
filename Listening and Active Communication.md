# Listening and Active Communication

## 1. Active Listening

Definition: The act of fully hearing and comprehending the meaning of what someone else is saying.

Active listening shows that the listener is hearing what the person is saying and acknowledges the person speaking.

### Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

- Avoid getting distracted by your thoughts
- Focus on the speaker and topic instead
- Try not to interrupt the other person
- Let them finish and then respond
- Use door-openers (phrases that show your interest & keep the other person talking )
- Align your body language to show that you are listening
- Take Notes
- Paraphrase to make sure you're both on the same page

## 2. Reflective Listening

Definition: Reflective listening is the act of reverting a paraphrased version of the speaker’s message to them. The message includes more than just the words the speaker communicates. It also includes any emotions they’re expressing.

Reflective listening involves the listener reflecting on the words of the person or reflecting on the feeling that the person used.

### Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

- Reflective listening is not about repeating the speaker's words but genuinely understanding and expressing what we feel the other person said
- Empathy is at the heart of reflective listening
- Reflective listening is a style of communication that works collaboratively to encourage change
- Reflective listening requires keeping the other person's tone and other nonverbal clues in mind
- Using empathy to actively listen allows for a better understanding of the context between both parties, this makes reflective listening effective in a therapeutic setting
- Take notes in technical discussions so that minute details don't slip from the mind when you get down to implementing

- Don't have the habit of making notes

### Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?

- Work on increasing my duration of focus

## 4. Types of Communication

### Question 5: When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

- If during conversations, I am not convinced of the opinions or perceptions of the other person
- When because of my previous experiences I know that with some people on some particulars topics/context, my thoughts and desires would not be of any significant value and might not be considered
- When I am not in the mood for a conversation or indulge in something and someone tries to have a conversation (for example, if I am playing table tennis or painting and someone tries to slip in through a conversation)
- If even after concluding something in the past with the speaker, there is a repetition of the same act

### Question 6: When do you switch to Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

- When I am unable to express my views properly due to being in a disturbed state of mind
- Whenever the conversation pertains to something I am low-key insecure about
- When its difficult being on the same page in regards to something or I get frustrated and believe that I can get away with being aggressive in communication with someone
- If someone tries to subdue an important issue that needs to be addressed
- If even after concluding on something in the past with the speaker, there is a repetition of the same act but it crosses my thresholds of tolerance
- After going through the resources mentioned in this assignment, I did realize that I have been aggressive in communication mostly in the subjects where I have been passive initially for a substantial period.

### Question 7: When do you switch to Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?

- When I find the other person being dishonest on a subject
- If someone tries to subdue an important issue that needs to be addressed
- When my peers start gossiping/taunting/roasting, I have occasionally found myself to tend to give in to the crowd even though I often try to keep my virtues
- When I don't have a good opinion of the speaker due to past experiences

### Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive? You can analyze the videos and then think about what steps you can apply in your own life. (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)

- Try to recognize and know my own feelings/expectations/requirements and after self-analysis, let the other person know them in a very respectful manner

- Try to find the cause of my opinions and try to rationalise them before accepting them fully

- Try and practice assertive communication with my friends/family and in easygoing situations first and eventually work and polish this skill over time

- Improve my body language & tone to better suit the situation and work on my non-verbal communication skills

- Learn to practice assertive communication from the very start and not subdue it till things go out of our control
