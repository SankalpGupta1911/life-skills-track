# Good practices for software development

## Question 1: What is your one major takeaway from each one of the 6 sections. So 6 points in total.

### 1. Gathering requirements:
<br/>
Try to use Trello/Jira/Handwritten notes for documentation while discussing requirements with your team and share it with the team to get instant feedbacks which will serve as references for future conversations.
<br/>
<br/>

### 2. Always over-communicate: Some scenarios:
<br/>
If there is any hindrance/delay/issues that may cause a change in the deadlines or have even the slightest of effect, try to over-communicate with the relevant/affected team/individuals, preferably through group chats/channels. and always try to revert immediately whenever contacted.
<br/>
<br/>

### 3. Stuck? Ask questions
<br/>
Whenever trying to get your questions answered, try to frame a question along with all the relevant content like code snippets, diagrams, flow charts and the solutions that you tried (You can try leveraging gitHub gists, sandboxes, codepen) and try to learn how issues are reported in large open-source projects.
<br/>
<br/>

### 4. Get to know your teammates
<br/>
Try to build rapport with your team, by joining meetings a bit early and learning about your teammates' schedule so that you can connect with them when they are available.
<br/>
<br/>

### 5. Be aware and mindful of other team members
<br/>
To get work done quicker, opt for a real-time conversation but if its not possible for your team members to get on a call with you, try to send a slack/Whatsapp message and instead of bombarding them with multiple messages, write down all the queries in a single message and also choose the comunication medium as per the situation.
<br/>
<br/>

### 6. Doing things with 100% involvement
<br/>
Try to keep track of your activities throughout the day, remove/reduce distractions, work while you work and play while you play and have a good balance of food and excercise in your life.
<br/>
<br/>

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I believe I majorly need to work on:

1. My attention span and deep work

2. Over-communication in cases of plan changes/delay/hindrances

3. Working while I work and playing while I play

To make progress in these:

1. I shall learn more about deep work and try to implement it by starting it as a tiny habit and then work to enhance it.

2. I hesitate to communicate with others when something goes wrong in my plan of work. I shall try to solidify the mentality that not communicating in situations like this can cause extreme situations and put me in a tricky spots and thus overcome the hesitation.

3. Due to my corrigible attention span, I often suffer from getting distracted/zoning out multiple times while working or playing. This I believe can be helped once I have gone through step1.
