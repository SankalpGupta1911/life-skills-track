 Sexual Harassment
## What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?
I believe there are a lot of factors and behavioral traits that lead to incidents of sexual harassment. Among these the most important are :
1. The upbringing 
2. The cultural background
3. The value systems imbibed since childhood and established by the individual themselves 
4. The relative power and status of the men and women in our society.

The upbringing of a person greatly affects the person's mindset and thinking. It is what shapes a person's thoughts and commands their actions to a huge extent.
This is why parents need to lay focus on educating themselves with sex education and then create an environment of healthy discussions and exploration with the kids so that they can put forward all thoughts that each of them came across either on their own or through their peer circles. Only then will they be able to move forward and be able to educate the young little brains with sex education.

Individuals often lack knowledge about the signs of harassment, its effects, and the appropriate solutions. This leads to the initial minor signs of harassment often being neglected or ignored by the individuals, peer groups, coworkers or organizations, or individuals not knowing what they are supposed to do when or if they come across an incident of sexual harassment or assault.
People when not given proper sex education, also lack self-confidence because of the way they have been socialized and are customized to suffer in silence.

In most cases, men that are often brought up with macho beliefs, do not consider females as their equals but instead consider women inferior to themselves and easily carry these values into the workplace. Such a patriarchal perspective creates an atmosphere that imbibes in men a sense of freedom to sexually harass someone in the workplace, while women remain vulnerable.

Often, sexual harassment is also seen as a game of power, this is where quid pro quo(This for that) comes into the picture. Here the perpetrator insists on sexual favors in exchange for the benefits they can dispense due to their prevailed position. The 'casting couch' is probably the best-known example of such a situation.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

Regardless of the type of harassment, I believe it is important to document everything from the beginning. Writing down details such as:

* The date, time, and location of the harassment, what happened, what was said, and who witnessed the behavior. I'd try keeping copies or screenshots of any relevant emails, texts, photos or social posts. 

* Telling a trusted person what happened and writing down the details of those conversations. 

* Keeping records related to your productivity and job performance. This is so that we have evidence should your performance ever be disputed.

* Storing all documentation outside the office or work computer and making sure it is backed up in a safe place.   

To figure out what to do in response to sexual harassment, we ought to ask ourselves the following questions:

* What result do I want? Do I want the perpetrator fired, do I just want the harassment to stop or do I want to move to a new role or group?

* I'll try to assess how seriously does my company take sexual harassment? I might be inclined to complain if I am indicated that my complaint will be taken seriously and vice-versa. I might also check and opt for the procedure laid by my organization's guidelines.

* Do I have family and friends who can support me? If I have enough resources to get by if I must leave my job? 

* What about the support I have at my job? If I have a good working relationship with someone who is in a senior role or if I have coworkers who would back up my account of what happened or might come forward with me? 

So once I have a record of the incident with its details and I have made up my mind about what course of action I want to take moving forward, I'd try to connect with my supervisors or managers. I shall pass on the relevant details and actively connect with them regarding the manner my complaint is being dealt with. A positive corporate culture, in which the rights and dignity of all staff members are
respected, and a positive example is set by management, will do much to create a healthy
environment in which sexual harassment cannot flourish. Although no policy can be expected to eliminate the problem, we are convinced that awareness of the problem and of ways to deal with it will help to reduce its extent dramatically. Women, together with personnel and employee assistance professionals, must take initiative and get
their companies to act against harassment if a program is not yet in place. Equally importantly, the appropriate professionals must assist victims of past and present harassment to overcome the negative effects of that experience.
